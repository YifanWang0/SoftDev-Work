K17 -- Deeper Into D3
2020-04-08

Letâ€™s Make a Bar Chart, Part I:
  - Allows us to select a bulk of elements at once and apply operations
  - Allows for chaining methods as opposed to making multiple variables and
   repeating operations for selections
  - No need for lots of local variables
  - Use local variables as references to selections to retrace your steps
  - selection.attr and selection.style can be constant or function-based
    - if you want to change the data based on the current attribute, then you
      need to make it a function
  - scaleLinear can make functions by specifying domain and range

 Learn D3: By Example (Some things we thought were cool)
  - There are functions to calculate the stats of a given data set and make
    them into certain diagrams
  - You can make "drawings" using cool effects, such as watercolors and dots
    - Can change the blur and strokes for watercolor
  - For Epicyclic Gear, if you zoom in, you can change the speed
  - You can make labels look nice by curving the words based on the shape of
    the box using centerline labeling
  - Polar Clock denotes real time (including date) in a circular format with
    different sized circles
