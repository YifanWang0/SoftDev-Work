1:
  - getElementsByTagName creates a list of all elements with the given tag
  - When box is clicked, it displays the innerHTML in an alert

2:
  - Very similar to how V1 works except now three alerts are displayed when you
    click inside the box
  - Alerts displayed in the order that addEventListener was written: td, tr, table
  - Q: Does it by default display the alerts in the order of how it was written or
    or innermost to outermost
    A: innermost to outermost

3:
  - When the argument true is added to an addEventListener, it first handles the event
    for that element
  - e.stopPropagation() interrupts the sequence of alerts and stops the remaining
    from being displayed

4:
  - When the argument true is added to multiple addEventListener's, the order of the
    events is the from outermost to innermost
  - Similar to 3, when e.stopPropagation() is uncommented, only one alert get displayed
